### DS-140-Crypto-Currency-Project

In my Data Science 140 class at the University of Mount Union, I was tasked with using various skills I learned to perform statistical tests on.

I chose to research crypto currency because of it's unique position as both a great yet risky investment for the average American.

In this project, you will find python notebooks and excel workbooks containing the various work I did in order to complete this project as well as the final report I did afterwards.

For any viewers, I hope you enjoy.
